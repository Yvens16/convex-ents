# Convex Ents

Convex Ents are an ergonomic layer on top of the [Convex](https://convex.dev)
built-in [`ctx.db`](https://docs.convex.dev/database) API for reading from and
writing to the database.

Convex Ents:

1. build upon the relational capabilities of the database to provide an easier
   way to query related documents.
2. enable providing defaults for easier document shape evolution.

Convex Ents are loosely inspired by the powerful Ent framework developed at
Facebook. You can learn more about it in
[this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKp_LUFk8EU), and see its
open-source JS implementation at [ent.dev](https://ent.dev/).

Convex Ents provide similar capabilities to
[Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/client), but target only Convex, and use
neither proprietary schema language nor SQL concepts nor code generation. Convex
Ents are a pure TypeScript/JavaScript library.
