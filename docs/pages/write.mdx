# Writing Ents to the Database

Just like for [reading](/read) ents from the database, for writing Convex Ents
provide a `ctx.table` method which replaces the built-in `ctx.db` object in
[Convex mutations](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions).

## Security

The same [added level of security](/read#security) applies to the writing ents
as it does to reading them.

## Inserting a new ent

You can insert new ents in the database with the `insert` method chained to the
result of calling `ctx.table`:

```ts
const taskId = await ctx.table("tasks").insert({ text: "Win at life" });
```

## Inserting many new ents

```ts
const taskIds = await ctx
  .table("tasks")
  .insertMany({ text: "Buy socks" }, { text: "Buy socks" });
```
